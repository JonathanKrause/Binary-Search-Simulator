# Binary-Search-Simulator
Contains the Java source code and README for my Binary Search Simulator.

Binary Search Simulator is a project designed to help students practice an optimal binary search on a number. I created this project to better understand the binary search algorithm and how to implement it in a programming language.

The user will input an amount of digits that they want to perform a Binary Search on. For instance, if I enter "3", the program will generate a random number between 1 and 999. It is the user's job to try and perform an optimal Binary Search on this number. If the number of guesses it takes for you to guess the number correctly is the same as the one computed by the program, you have successfully performed Binary Search on the number! If not, you did not perform the algorithm optimally.

The Java code can be ran with any Java compiler. The application contains 1 class, BinarySearchSimulator.java, and all of the I/O takes place on the console.
